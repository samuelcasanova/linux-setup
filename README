# Personal Linux Setup

This repo is intended to store all the dotfiles and scripts needed to setup a new laptop with all my setup ready to be used

# First step

Install git in order to clone all the scripts and tools.
- Already installed in Kubuntu, otherwise install git: `sudo atp-get install -y git`
- Copy the public and private keys to access github on ~/.ssh/
- Configure SSH: `chmod 600 ~/.ssh/* && eval "$(ssh-agent -s)" && ssh-add ~/.ssh/linux_github_samuel_casanova_gmail`
- Clone the setup repositories: `mkdir -p ~/git/setups && cd ~/git/setups && git clone git@github.com:samuelcasanova/linux-setup.git && git clone git@github.com:samuelcasanova/linux-setup-private.git`
- Execute install.sh script

# Post install

Complete these steps after the install is complete:
- Login to your Google personal account in Chrome, then Immfly, then Testing
- Make the main display "Primary" and switch monitors order
- Press Win+T and configure Tiling (not needed in the last setup)
