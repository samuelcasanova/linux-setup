# Personal Linux Setup

This repo is intended to store all the dotfiles and scripts needed to setup a new laptop with all my setup ready to be used

# First step

Install git in order to clone all the scripts and tools. These steps are for Fedora:
- Copy the public and private keys to access github on ~/.ssh/
- Install git: `sudo dnf install git`
- Configure SSH: `eval "$(ssh-agent -s)" && ssh-add ~/.ssh/fedora_linux_github_samuel_casanova_gmail`
- Clone the public repository: `mkdir ~/git && cd ~/git && git clone git@github.com:samuelcasanova/linux-setup.git`
