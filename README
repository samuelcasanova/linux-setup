# Personal Linux Setup

This repo is intended to store all the dotfiles and scripts needed to setup a new laptop with all my setup ready to be used

- Configure SSH: `eval "$(ssh-agent -s)" && ssh-add ~/.ssh/fedora_linux_github_samuel_casanova_gmail`
- Clone the public repository: `mkdir -p ~/git/setups && cd ~/git/setups && git clone git@github.com:samuelcasanova/setups/linux-setup.git`

# Post install
